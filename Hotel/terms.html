    <p>Our hotel and catering services are committed to providing a delightful experience for all guests. Reservations are subject to availability and must be confirmed with a valid payment method. Cancellations or modifications to bookings must be made at least 48 hours prior to the scheduled date to avoid cancellation charges. Catering services require a minimum lead time of seven days for event preparation, with the final guest count and menu confirmation required at least three days before the event. Any damages to property, equipment, or additional services incurred during a guest's stay or event will be billed to the responsible party. Our services maintain high standards of hygiene and quality; however, specific dietary restrictions or allergies must be communicated in advance. By using our services, guests agree to abide by these terms and respect the policies established to ensure a safe and enjoyable experience for all.</p>
